## A Simple personal blog application created using the MERN stack

Add an .env file with the following vars to config:
PORT: <port in which the BE server will run>
MONGODB_URI: <access string from your mongodb database>

How to run server: 
1. go to backend folder
2. run `node app.js`

How to run react app:
1. go to frontend folder
2. run `npm run start`

Had fun learning the BE part, but I made a few noob mistakes such as exposing the MONGODB access credentials. I've remedied it by changing the password and creating an .env file.
